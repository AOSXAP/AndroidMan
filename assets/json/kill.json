      "DESCRIPTION" : [
         "The  default  signal for kill is TERM.  Use -l or -L to list available signals.  Particularly useful signals include HUP, INT, KILL, STOP, CONT, and 0.  Alternate signals may be specified in three ways:  -9,  -SIGKILL or -KILL.  Negative PID values may be used to choose whole process groups; see the PGID column in ps command output.  A PID of -1 is special; it indicates all processes except the kill process itself and init. "
      ],
      "EXAMPLES" : [
         "kill -9 -1 Kill all processes you can kill. ",
         "kill -l 11 Translate number 11 into a signal name. ",
         "kill -L List the available signal choices in a nice table. ",
         "kill 123 543 2341 3453 Send the default signal, SIGTERM, to all those processes. ",

      "NAME" : [
         "kill - send a signal to a process "
      ],
      "OPTIONS" : [
         "<pid> [...] Send signal to every <pid> listed. ",
         "-<signal> -s <signal> --signal <signal> Specify the signal to be sent.  The signal can be specified by using name or number.  The behavior of signals is explained in signal(7) manual page. ",
         "-q, --queue value Use  sigqueue(3)  rather than kill(2) and the value argument is used to specify an integer to be sent with the signal. If the receiving process has installed a handler for this signal using  the  SA_SIG‐ INFO  flag  to  sigaction(2)  ,  then it can obtain this data via the si_value field of the siginfo_t structure. ",
         "-l, --list [signal] List signal names.  This option has optional argument, which will convert  signal  number  to  signal name, or other way round. ",
         "-L, --table List signal names in a nice table. ",
         "NOTES  Your shell (command line interpreter) may have a built-in kill command.  You may need to run the com‐ mand described here as /bin/kill to solve the conflict. "

      "STANDARDS" : [
         "This command meets appropriate standards.  The -L flag is Linux-specific. "
