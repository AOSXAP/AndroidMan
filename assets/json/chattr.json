         "a      A file with the 'a' attribute set can only be opened in append mode for writing.  Only the  superuser or a process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or clear this attribute. ",
         "A      When  a file with the 'A' attribute set is accessed, its atime record is not modified.  This avoids a certain amount of disk I/O for laptop systems. ",
         "c      A file with the 'c' attribute set is automatically compressed on the disk by the kernel.  A read from this file returns uncompressed data.  A write to this file compresses data before storing them on the disk.  Note: please make sure to read the bugs and limitations section at the end of  this  document. (Note:  For btrfs, If the 'c' flag is set, then the 'C' flag cannot be set. Also conflicts with btrfs mount option 'nodatasum') ",
         "C      A file with the 'C' attribute set will not be subject to copy-on-write updates.  This  flag  is  only supported  on file systems which perform copy-on-write.  (Note: For btrfs, the 'C' flag should be set on new or empty files.  If it is set on a file which already has data blocks, it  is  undefined  when the blocks assigned to the file will be fully stable.  If the 'C' flag is set on a directory, it will have no effect on the directory, but new files created in that directory will have the No_COW  attri‐ bute set. If the 'C' flag is set, then the 'c' flag cannot be set.) ",
         "d      A file with the 'd' attribute set is not a candidate for backup when the dump(8) program is run. ",
         "D      When a directory with the 'D' attribute set is modified, the changes are written synchronously to the disk; this is equivalent to the 'dirsync' mount option applied to a subset of the files. ",
         "e      The 'e' attribute indicates that the file is using extents for mapping the blocks on  disk.   It  may not be removed using chattr(1). ",
         "E      A  file,  directory, or symlink with the 'E' attribute set is encrypted by the file system.  This at‐ tribute may not be set or cleared using chattr(1), although it can be displayed by lsattr(1). ",
         "F      A directory with the 'F' attribute set indicates that all the path lookups inside that directory  are made  in a case-insensitive fashion.  This attribute can only be changed in empty directories on file systems with the casefold feature enabled. ",
         "i      A file with the 'i' attribute cannot be modified: it cannot be deleted or renamed,  no  link  can  be created to this file, most of the file's metadata can not be modified, and the file can not be opened in write mode.  Only the superuser or a process possessing the CAP_LINUX_IMMUTABLE capability can set or clear this attribute. ",
         "I      The  'I'  attribute  is  used  by  the htree code to indicate that a directory is being indexed using hashed trees.  It may not be set or  cleared  using  chattr(1),  although  it  can  be  displayed  by lsattr(1). ",
         "j      A  file  with  the 'j' attribute has all of its data written to the ext3 or ext4 journal before being written to the file itself, if the file system is mounted with the data=ordered or data=writeback options  and  the file system has a journal.  When the file system is mounted with the data=journal option all file data is already journalled and this attribute has no effect.  Only the superuser or a process possessing the CAP_SYS_RESOURCE capability can set or clear this attribute. ",
         "m      A file with the 'm' attribute is excluded from compression on file systems that support per-file com‐ pression. ",
         "N      A file with the 'N' attribute set indicates that the file has data stored inline,  within  the  inode itself. It may not be set or cleared using chattr(1), although it can be displayed by lsattr(1). ",
         "P      A  directory with the 'P' attribute set will enforce a hierarchical structure for project id's.  This means that files and directories created in the directory will inherit the project id of  the  direc‐ tory,  rename operations are constrained so when a file or directory is moved into another directory, that the project ids must match.  In addition, a hard link to file  can  only  be  created  when  the project id for the file and the destination directory match. ",
         "s      When  a  file  with  the  's' attribute set is deleted, its blocks are zeroed and written back to the disk.  Note: please make sure to read the bugs and limitations section at the end of this document. ",
         "S      When a file with the 'S' attribute set is modified, the changes  are  written  synchronously  to  the disk; this is equivalent to the 'sync' mount option applied to a subset of the files. ",
         "t      A  file  with  the 't' attribute will not have a partial block fragment at the end of the file merged with other files (for those file systems which support tail-merging).  This is necessary for applica‐ tions such as LILO which read the file system directly, and which don't understand tail-merged files. Note: As of this writing, the ext2, ext3, and ext4 file systems do not support tail-merging. ",
         "T      A directory with the 'T' attribute will be deemed to be the top of directory hierarchies for the pur‐ poses of the Orlov block allocator.  This is a hint to the block allocator used by ext3 and ext4 that the subdirectories under this directory are not related, and thus should be spread apart for  alloca‐ tion  purposes.   For example it is a very good idea to set the 'T' attribute on the /home directory, so that /home/john and /home/mary are placed into separate block groups.  For directories where  this attribute  is  not  set,  the  Orlov block allocator will try to group subdirectories closer together where possible. ",
         "u      When a file with the 'u' attribute set is deleted, its contents are saved.  This allows the  user  to ask  for  its undeletion.  Note: please make sure to read the bugs and limitations section at the end of this document. ",
         "x      The 'x' attribute can be set on a directory or file.  If the attribute is set on an  existing  direc‐ tory,  it  will be inherited by all files and subdirectories that are subsequently created in the di‐ rectory.  If an existing directory has contained some files and subdirectories, modifying the  attri‐ bute on the parent directory doesn't change the attributes on these files and subdirectories. ",
         "V      A  file with the 'V' attribute set has fs-verity enabled.  It cannot be written to, and the file sys‐ tem will automatically verify all data read from it against a cryptographic hash that covers the  en‐ tire file's contents, e.g. via a Merkle tree.  This makes it possible to efficiently authenticate the file.  This attribute may not be set or cleared using chattr(1), although  it  can  be  displayed  by lsattr(1). "
