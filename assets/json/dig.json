      "DESCRIPTION" : [
         "dig is a flexible tool for interrogating DNS name servers. It performs DNS lookups and displays the  answers that are returned from the name server(s) that were queried. Most DNS administrators use dig to troubleshoot DNS problems because of its flexibility, ease of use, and clarity of output. Other lookup tools tend to have less functionality than dig. ",
         "Although dig is normally used with command-line arguments, it also has a batch mode of operation for reading lookup requests from a file. A brief summary of its command-line arguments and options is printed  when  the -h  option  is given. The BIND 9 implementation of dig allows multiple lookups to be issued from the command line. ",
         "Unless it is told to query a specific name server, dig tries each of the servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf. If no usable server addresses are found, dig sends the query to the local host. ",
         "When no command-line arguments or options are given, dig performs an NS query for . (the root). ",
         "It  is possible to set per-user defaults for dig via ${HOME}/.digrc. This file is read and any options in it are applied before the command-line arguments. The -r option disables this feature, for  scripts  that  need predictable behavior. ",
         "The  IN  and  CH class names overlap with the IN and CH top-level domain names. Either use the -t and -c op‐ tions to specify the type and class, use the -q to specify the domain name, or  use  IN.  and  CH.  when looking up these top-level domains. ",
         "SIMPLE USAGE A typical invocation of dig looks like: ",
         "dig @server name type ",
         "where: ",
         "server is  the name or IP address of the name server to query. This can be an IPv4 address in dotted-decimal notation or an IPv6 address in colon-delimited notation. When the supplied server argument is a host‐ name, dig resolves that name before querying that name server. ",
         "If  no  server  argument is provided, dig consults /etc/resolv.conf; if an address is found there, it queries the name server at that address. If either of the -4 or -6 options are in use, then only  ad‐ dresses  for  the  corresponding transport are tried. If no usable addresses are found, dig sends the query to the local host. The reply from the name server that responds is displayed. ",
         "name   is the name of the resource record that is to be looked up. ",
         "type   indicates what type of query is required - ANY, A, MX, SIG, etc.  type can be any valid  query  type. If no type argument is supplied, dig performs a lookup for an A record. "

      "OPTIONS" : [
         "-4     This option indicates that only IPv4 should be used. ",
         "-6     This option indicates that only IPv6 should be used. ",
         "-b address[#port] This  option  sets  the source IP address of the query. The address must be a valid address on one of the host's network interfaces, or 0.0.0.0 or ::. An optional port may be specified  by  appending #port. ",
         "-c class This option sets the query class. The default class is IN; other classes are HS for Hesiod records or CH for Chaosnet records. ",
         "-f file This option sets batch mode, in which dig reads a list of lookup requests to process from  the  given file.  Each  line in the file should be organized in the same way it would be presented as a query to dig using the command-line interface. ",
         "-h     Print a usage summary. ",
         "-k keyfile This option tells dig to sign queries using TSIG or SIG(0) using a key read from the given file.  Key files  can  be  generated using tsig-keygen. When using TSIG authentication with dig, the name server that is queried needs to know the key and algorithm that is being used. In BIND, this is done by pro‐ viding  appropriate key and server statements in named.conf for TSIG and by looking up the KEY record in zone data for SIG(0). ",
         "-m     This option enables memory usage debugging. ",
         "-p port This option sends the query to a non-standard port on the server, instead of  the  default  port  53. This  option  is  used  to  test  a  name  server that has been configured to listen for queries on a non-standard port number. ",
         "-q name This option specifies the domain name to query. This is useful to distinguish the name from other ar‐ guments. ",
         "-r     This option indicates that options from ${HOME}/.digrc should not be read. This is useful for scripts that need predictable behavior. ",
         "-t type This option indicates the resource record type to query, which can be any valid query type. If it  is a  resource  record  type  supported  in  BIND 9, it can be given by the type mnemonic (such as NS or AAAA). The default query type is A, unless the -x option is supplied to indicate a reverse lookup.  A zone transfer can be requested by specifying a type of AXFR. When an incremental zone transfer (IXFR) is required, set the type to ixfr=N. The incremental zone transfer contains all changes made  to  the zone since the serial number in the zone's SOA record was N. ",
         "All  resource record types can be expressed as TYPEnn, where nn is the number of the type. If the re‐ source record type is not supported in BIND 9, the result is displayed as described in RFC 3597. ",
         "-u     This option indicates that print query times should be provided in microseconds instead of  millisec‐ onds. ",
         "-v     This option prints the version number and exits. ",
         "-x addr This  option sets simplified reverse lookups, for mapping addresses to names. The addr is an IPv4 ad‐ dress in dotted-decimal notation, or a colon-delimited IPv6 address. When  the  -x  option  is  used, there is no need to provide the name, class, and type arguments.  dig automatically performs a lookup for a name like 94.2.0.192.in-addr.arpa and sets the query type and class to PTR and IN respectively. IPv6 addresses are looked up using nibble format under the IP6.ARPA domain. ",
         "-y [hmac:]keyname:secret This  option  signs queries using TSIG with the given authentication key.  keyname is the name of the key, and secret is the base64-encoded shared secret. hmac is the name of  the  key  algorithm;  valid choices  are  hmac-md5,  hmac-sha1, hmac-sha224, hmac-sha256, hmac-sha384, or hmac-sha512. If hmac is not specified, the default is hmac-md5; if MD5 was disabled, the default is hmac-sha256. ",
         "NOTE: Only the -k option should be used, rather than the -y option, because with -y the shared secret  is  sup‐ plied  as  a command-line argument in clear text. This may be visible in the output from ps1 or in a his‐ tory file maintained by the user's shell. ",
         "QUERY OPTIONS dig provides a number of query options which affect the way in which lookups are made and the  results  dis‐ played.  Some  of these set or reset flag bits in the query header, some determine which sections of the an‐ swer get printed, and others determine the timeout and retry strategies. ",
         "Each query option is identified by a keyword preceded by a plus sign (+). Some keywords set or reset an  op‐ tion;  these  may  be preceded by the string no to negate the meaning of that keyword. Other keywords assign values to options, like the timeout interval. They have the form +keyword=value. Keywords  may  be  abbrevi‐ ated, provided the abbreviation is unambiguous; for example, +cd is equivalent to +cdflag. The query options are: ",
         "+aaflag, +noaaflag This option is a synonym for +aaonly, +noaaonly. ",
         "+aaonly, +noaaonly This option sets the aa flag in the query. ",
         "+additional, +noadditional This option displays [or does not display] the additional section of a reply. The default is to  dis‐ play it. ",
         "+adflag, +noadflag This option sets [or does not set] the AD (authentic data) bit in the query. This requests the server to return whether all of the answer and authority sections have been validated as  secure,  according to  the  security policy of the server. AD=1 indicates that all records have been validated as secure and the answer is not from a OPT-OUT range. AD=0 indicates that some part of the answer was  insecure or not validated.  This bit is set by default. ",
         "+all, +noall This option sets or clears all display flags. ",
         "+answer, +noanswer This  option  displays [or does not display] the answer section of a reply. The default is to display it. ",
         "+authority, +noauthority This option displays [or does not display] the authority section of a reply. The default is  to  dis‐ play it. ",
         "+badcookie, +nobadcookie This option retries the lookup with a new server cookie if a BADCOOKIE response is received. ",
         "+besteffort, +nobesteffort This  option  attempts to display the contents of messages which are malformed. The default is to not display malformed answers. ",
         "+bufsize[=B] This option sets the UDP message buffer size advertised using EDNS0 to B bytes.  The maximum and min‐ imum sizes of this buffer are 65535 and 0, respectively.  +bufsize restores the default buffer size. ",
         "+cd, +cdflag, +nocdflag This  option  sets  [or  does not set] the CD (checking disabled) bit in the query. This requests the server to not perform DNSSEC validation of responses. ",
         "+class, +noclass This option displays [or does not display] the CLASS when printing the record. ",
         "+cmd, +nocmd This option toggles the printing of the initial comment in the output, identifying the version of dig and  the  query  options that have been applied. This option always has a global effect; it cannot be set globally and then overridden on a per-lookup basis. The default is to print this comment. ",
         "+comments, +nocomments This option toggles the display of some comment lines in  the  output,  with  information  about  the packet  header  and OPT pseudosection, and the names of the response section. The default is to print these comments. ",
         "Other types of comments in the output are not affected by this option, but can  be  controlled  using other command-line switches. These include +cmd, +question, +stats, and +rrcomments. ",
         "+cookie=####, +nocookie This option sends [or does not send] a COOKIE EDNS option, with an optional value. Replaying a COOKIE from a previous response allows the server to identify a previous client. The default is +cookie. ",
         "+cookie is also set when +trace is set to better emulate the default queries from a nameserver. ",
         "+crypto, +nocrypto This option toggles the display of cryptographic fields in DNSSEC  records.  The  contents  of  these fields  are unnecessary for debugging most DNSSEC validation failures and removing them makes it eas‐ ier to see the common failures. The default is to display the fields. When omitted, they are replaced by  the  string  [omitted] or, in the DNSKEY case, the key ID is displayed as the replacement, e.g. [ key id = value ]. ",
         "+defname, +nodefname This option, which is deprecated, is treated as a synonym for +search, +nosearch. ",
         "+dns64prefix, +nodns64prefix Lookup IPV4ONLY.ARPA AAAA and print any DNS64 prefixes found. ",
         "+dnssec, +do, +nodnssec, +nodo This option requests that DNSSEC records be sent by setting the DNSSEC OK (DO) bit in the OPT  record in the additional section of the query. ",
         "+domain=somename This  option  sets the search list to contain the single domain somename, as if specified in a domain directive in /etc/resolv.conf, and enables search list processing  as  if  the  +search  option  were given. ",
         "+dscp=value This  option  formerly  set the DSCP value used when sending a query.  It is now obsolete, and has no effect. ",
         "+edns[=#], +noedns This option specifies the EDNS version to query with. Valid values are 0 to 255.   Setting  the  EDNS version  causes an EDNS query to be sent.  +noedns clears the remembered EDNS version. EDNS is set to 0 by default. ",
         "+ednsflags[=#], +noednsflags This option sets the must-be-zero EDNS flags bits (Z bits) to the specified value.  Decimal, hex, and octal  encodings  are accepted. Setting a named flag (e.g., DO) is silently ignored. By default, no Z bits are set. ",
         "+ednsnegotiation, +noednsnegotiation This option enables/disables EDNS version negotiation. By default, EDNS version  negotiation  is  en‐ abled. ",
         "+ednsopt[=code[:value]], +noednsopt This  option  specifies  the  EDNS  option with code point code and an optional payload of value as a hexadecimal string. code can be either an EDNS option name (for example, NSID or ECS) or an arbitrary numeric value. +noednsopt clears the EDNS options to be sent. ",
         "+expire, +noexpire This option sends an EDNS Expire option. ",
         "+fail, +nofail This  option  indicates that named should try [or not try] the next server if a SERVFAIL is received. The default is to not try the next server, which is the reverse of normal stub resolver behavior. ",
         "+fuzztime[=value], +nofuzztime This option allows the signing time to be specified when generating signed messages.  If a  value  is specified it is the seconds since 00:00:00 January 1, 1970 UTC ignoring leap seconds.  If no value is specified 1646972129 (Fri 11 Mar 2022 04:15:29 UTC) is used.  The default is +nofuzztime and the cur‐ rent time is used. ",
         "+header-only, +noheader-only This option sends a query with a DNS header without a question section. The default is to add a ques‐ tion section. The query type and query name are ignored when this is set. ",
         "+https[=value], +nohttps This option indicates whether to use DNS over HTTPS (DoH) when querying name servers.  When this  op‐ tion is in use, the port number defaults to 443.  The HTTP POST request mode is used when sending the query. ",
         "If value is specified, it will be used as the  HTTP  endpoint  in  the  query  URI;  the  default  is /dns-query. So, for example, dig @example.com +https will use the URI https://example.com/dns-query. ",
         "+https-get[=value], +nohttps-get Similar to +https, except that the HTTP GET request mode is used when sending the query. ",
         "+https-post[=value], +nohttps-post Same as +https. ",
         "+http-plain[=value], +nohttp-plain Similar  to +https, except that HTTP queries will be sent over a non-encrypted channel. When this op‐ tion is in use, the port number defaults to 80 and the HTTP request mode is POST. ",
         "+http-plain-get[=value], +nohttp-plain-get Similar to +http-plain, except that the HTTP request mode is GET. ",
         "+http-plain-post[=value], +nohttp-plain-post Same as +http-plain. ",
         "+identify, +noidentify This option shows [or does not show] the IP address and port number that supplied  the  answer,  when the  +short  option  is  enabled. If short form answers are requested, the default is not to show the source address and port number of the server that provided the answer. ",
         "+idnin, +noidnin This option processes [or does not process] IDN domain names on input. This requires IDN  SUPPORT  to have been enabled at compile time. ",
         "The  default  is  to process IDN input when standard output is a tty.  The IDN processing on input is disabled when dig output is redirected to files, pipes, and other non-tty file descriptors. ",
         "+idnout, +noidnout This option converts [or does not convert] puny code on output. This requires  IDN  SUPPORT  to  have been enabled at compile time. ",
         "The default is to process puny code on output when standard output is a tty. The puny code processing on output is disabled when dig output is redirected to files, pipes, and other non-tty file  descrip‐ tors. ",
         "+ignore, +noignore This option ignores [or does not ignore] truncation in UDP responses instead of retrying with TCP. By default, TCP retries are performed. ",
         "+keepalive, +nokeepalive This option sends [or does not send] an EDNS Keepalive option. ",
         "+keepopen, +nokeepopen This option keeps [or does not keep] the TCP socket open between queries, and reuses it  rather  than creating a new TCP socket for each lookup. The default is +nokeepopen. ",
         "+multiline, +nomultiline This  option prints [or does not print] records, like the SOA records, in a verbose multi-line format with human-readable comments. The default is to print each record on a single line to facilitate  ma‐ chine parsing of the dig output. ",
         "+ndots=D This  option  sets  the number of dots (D) that must appear in name for it to be considered absolute. The default value is that defined using the ndots statement in /etc/resolv.conf, or  1  if  no  ndots statement  is  present. Names with fewer dots are interpreted as relative names, and are searched for in the domains listed in the search or domain directive in /etc/resolv.conf if +search is set. ",
         "+nsid, +nonsid When enabled, this option includes an EDNS name server ID request when sending a query. ",
         "+nssearch, +nonssearch When this option is set, dig attempts to find the authoritative name servers for the zone  containing the  name  being  looked  up, and display the SOA record that each name server has for the zone.  Ad‐ dresses of servers that did not respond are also printed. ",
         "+onesoa, +noonesoa When enabled, this option prints only one (starting) SOA record when performing an AXFR. The  default is to print both the starting and ending SOA records. ",
         "+opcode=value, +noopcode When  enabled, this option sets (restores) the DNS message opcode to the specified value. The default value is QUERY (0). ",
         "+padding=value This option pads the size of the query packet using the EDNS Padding option to blocks of value bytes. For  example,  +padding=32 causes a 48-byte query to be padded to 64 bytes. The default block size is 0, which disables padding; the maximum is 512. Values are ordinarily expected to be  powers  of  two, such as 128; however, this is not mandatory. Responses to padded queries may also be padded, but only if the query uses TCP or DNS COOKIE. ",
         "+qid=value This option specifies the query ID to use when sending queries. ",
         "+qr, +noqr This option toggles the display of the query message as it is sent. By  default,  the  query  is  not printed. ",
         "+question, +noquestion This  option  toggles  the display of the question section of a query when an answer is returned. The default is to print the question section as a comment. ",
         "+raflag, +noraflag This option sets [or does not set] the RA (Recursion Available) bit in the query. The default is +no‐ raflag. This bit is ignored by the server for QUERY. ",
         "+rdflag, +nordflag This option is a synonym for +recurse, +norecurse. ",
         "+recurse, +norecurse This  option  toggles the setting of the RD (recursion desired) bit in the query.  This bit is set by default, which means dig normally sends recursive queries. Recursion is automatically  disabled  when the +nssearch or +trace query option is used. ",
         "+retry=T This  option  sets the number of times to retry UDP and TCP queries to server to T instead of the de‐ fault, 2.  Unlike +tries, this does not include the initial query. ",
         "+rrcomments, +norrcomments This option toggles the display of per-record comments in the output (for example, human-readable key information  about DNSKEY records). The default is not to print record comments unless multiline mode is active. ",
         "+search, +nosearch This option uses [or does not use] the search list defined by the searchlist or domain  directive  in resolv.conf, if any. The search list is not used by default. ",
         "ndots from resolv.conf (default 1), which may be overridden by +ndots, determines whether the name is treated as relative and hence whether a search is eventually performed. ",
         "+short, +noshort This option toggles whether a terse answer is provided. The default is to print the answer in a  ver‐ bose form. This option always has a global effect; it cannot be set globally and then overridden on a per-lookup basis. ",
         "+showbadcookie, +noshowbadcookie This option toggles whether to show the message containing the BADCOOKIE rcode  before  retrying  the request or not. The default is to not show the messages. ",
         "+showsearch, +noshowsearch This option performs [or does not perform] a search showing intermediate results. ",
         "+sigchase, +nosigchase This feature is now obsolete and has been removed; use delv instead. ",
         "+split=W This  option splits long hex- or base64-formatted fields in resource records into chunks of W charac‐ ters (where W is rounded up to the nearest multiple of 4). +nosplit or +split=0 causes fields not  to be split at all. The default is 56 characters, or 44 characters when multiline mode is active. ",
         "+stats, +nostats This  option toggles the printing of statistics: when the query was made, the size of the reply, etc. The default behavior is to print the query statistics as a comment after each lookup. ",
         "+subnet=addr[/prefix-length], +nosubnet This option sends [or does not send] an EDNS CLIENT-SUBNET option with the specified  IP  address  or network prefix. ",
         "dig  +subnet=0.0.0.0/0, or simply dig +subnet=0 for short, sends an EDNS CLIENT-SUBNET option with an empty address and a source prefix-length of zero, which signals a resolver that the client's  address information must not be used when resolving this query. ",
         "+tcflag, +notcflag This  option  sets  [or does not set] the TC (TrunCation) bit in the query. The default is +notcflag. This bit is ignored by the server for QUERY. ",
         "+tcp, +notcp This option indicates whether to use TCP when querying name servers.  The default behavior is to  use UDP  unless  a  type any or ixfr=N query is requested, in which case the default is TCP. AXFR queries always use TCP. To prevent retry over TCP when TC=1 is returned from a UDP query, use +ignore. ",
         "+timeout=T This option sets the timeout for a query to T seconds. The default timeout is 5 seconds.  An  attempt to set T to less than 1 is silently set to 1. ",
         "+tls, +notls This  option indicates whether to use DNS over TLS (DoT) when querying name servers. When this option is in use, the port number defaults to 853. ",
         "+tls-ca[=file-name], +notls-ca This option enables remote server TLS certificate validation for DNS transports, relying on TLS. Cer‐ tificate  authorities certificates are loaded from the specified PEM file (file-name). If the file is not specified, the default certificates from the global certificates store are used. ",
         "+tls-certfile=file-name, +tls-keyfile=file-name, +notls-certfile, +notls-keyfile These options set the state of certificate-based client authentication for DNS transports, relying on TLS. Both certificate chain file and private key file are expected to be in PEM format.  Both options must be specified at the same time. ",
         "+tls-hostname=hostname, +notls-hostname This option makes dig use the provided hostname during remote server  TLS  certificate  verification. Otherwise, the DNS server name is used. This option has no effect if +tls-ca is not specified. ",
         "+topdown, +notopdown This feature is related to dig +sigchase, which is obsolete and has been removed. Use delv instead. ",
         "+trace, +notrace This  option  toggles  tracing  of  the delegation path from the root name servers for the name being looked up. Tracing is disabled by default. When tracing is enabled, dig makes  iterative  queries  to resolve the name being looked up. It follows referrals from the root servers, showing the answer from each server that was used to resolve the lookup. ",
         "If @server is also specified, it affects only the initial query for the root zone name servers. ",
         "+dnssec is also set when +trace is set, to better emulate the default queries from a name server. ",
         "+tries=T This option sets the number of times to try UDP and TCP queries to server to T  instead  of  the  de‐ fault, 3. If T is less than or equal to zero, the number of tries is silently rounded up to 1. ",
         "+trusted-key=#### This  option formerly specified trusted keys for use with dig +sigchase. This feature is now obsolete and has been removed; use delv instead. ",
         "+ttlid, +nottlid This option displays [or does not display] the TTL when printing the record. ",
         "+ttlunits, +nottlunits This option displays [or does not display] the TTL in friendly human-readable time units of s, m,  h, d, and w, representing seconds, minutes, hours, days, and weeks. This implies +ttlid. ",
         "+unknownformat, +nounknownformat This  option  prints  all RDATA in unknown RR type presentation format (RFC 3597).  The default is to print RDATA for known types in the type's presentation format. ",
         "+vc, +novc This option uses [or does not use] TCP when querying name servers. This alternate syntax to  +tcp  is provided for backwards compatibility. The vc stands for virtual circuit. ",
         "+yaml, +noyaml When  enabled, this option prints the responses (and, if +qr is in use, also the outgoing queries) in a detailed YAML format. ",
         "+zflag, +nozflag This option sets [or does not set] the last unassigned DNS header flag in a DNS query.  This flag  is off by default. ",
         "MULTIPLE QUERIES The  BIND  9  implementation of dig supports specifying multiple queries on the command line (in addition to supporting the -f batch file option). Each of those queries can be supplied with its own set of  flags,  op‐ tions, and query options. ",
         "In this case, each query argument represents an individual query in the command-line syntax described above. Each consists of any of the standard options and flags, the name to be looked up, an optional query type and class, and any query options that should be applied to that query. ",
         "A  global  set  of query options, which should be applied to all queries, can also be supplied. These global query options must precede the first tuple of name, class, type, options, flags, and query options  supplied on  the  command  line.  Any  global  query  options (except +cmd and +short options) can be overridden by a query-specific set of query options. For example: ",

         "shows how dig can be used from the command line to make three lookups: an ANY query for www.isc.org,  a  re‐ verse  lookup  of  127.0.0.1, and a query for the NS records of isc.org. A global query option of +qr is ap‐ plied, so that dig shows the initial query it made for each lookup. The final query has a local query option of +noqr which means that dig does not print the initial query when it looks up the NS records for isc.org. ",
         "IDN SUPPORT If  dig has been built with IDN (internationalized domain name) support, it can accept and display non-ASCII domain names. dig appropriately converts character encoding of a domain name before sending a request  to  a DNS  server  or  displaying a reply from the server.  To turn off IDN support, use the parameters +idnin and +idnout, or define the IDN_DISABLE environment variable. ",
