         "This  manual page documents the GNU version of rm.  rm removes each specified file.  By default, it does not remove directories. ",
         "If the -I or --interactive=once option is given, and there are more than three files or the -r, -R, or --re‐ cursive  are  given,  then rm prompts the user for whether to proceed with the entire operation.  If the re‐ sponse is not affirmative, the entire command is aborted. ",
         "Otherwise, if a file is unwritable, standard input is a terminal, and the -f or --force option is not given, or  the  -i or --interactive=always option is given, rm prompts the user for whether to remove the file.  If the response is not affirmative, the file is skipped. "

         "-i     prompt before every removal ",
         "-I     prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively; less intrusive  than -i, while still giving protection against most mistakes ",
         "--interactive[=WHEN] prompt according to WHEN: never, once (-I), or always (-i); without WHEN, prompt always ",
         "--one-file-system when  removing  a  hierarchy  recursively, skip any directory that is on a file system different from that of the corresponding command line argument ",
         "--no-preserve-root do not treat '/' specially ",
         "--preserve-root[=all] do not remove '/' (default); with 'all', reject any command line argument on a separate  device  from its parent ",
         "-r, -R, --recursive remove directories and their contents recursively ",

         "By default, rm does not remove directories.  Use the --recursive (-r or -R) option to remove each listed di‐ rectory, too, along with all of its contents. ",
         "To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo', use one of these commands: ",
         "rm -- -foo ",
         "rm ./-foo ",
         "Note that if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover some of its contents, given suffi‐ cient  expertise and/or time.  For greater assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider us‐ ing shred. "
