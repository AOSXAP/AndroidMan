      "DESCRIPTION" : [
         "pgrep looks through the currently running processes and lists the process IDs which match the selection cri‐ teria to stdout.  All the criteria have to match.  For example, ",
         "$ pgrep -u root sshd ",
         "will only list the processes called sshd AND owned by root.  On the other hand, ",
         "$ pgrep -u root,daemon ",
         "will list the processes owned by root OR daemon. ",
         "pkill will send the specified signal (by default SIGTERM) to each process instead of listing them on stdout. ",
         "pidwait will wait for each process instead of listing them on stdout. "

         "-signal --signal signal Defines the signal to send to each matched process.  Either the numeric or the symbolic  signal  name can be used.  (pkill only.) ",
         "-c, --count Suppress  normal output; instead print a count of matching processes.  When count does not match any‐ thing, e.g. returns zero, the command will return non-zero value. Note that for  pkill  and  pidwait, the  count  is the number of matching processes, not the processes that were successfully signaled or waited for. ",
         "-d, --delimiter delimiter Sets the string used to delimit each process ID in the output (by default a newline).  (pgrep only.) ",
         "-e, --echo Display name and PID of the process being killed.  (pkill only.) ",
         "-f, --full The pattern is normally only matched against the process name.  When -f is set, the full command line is used. ",
         "-g, --pgroup pgrp,... Only  match  processes  in the process group IDs listed.  Process group 0 is translated into pgrep's, pkill's, or pidwait's own process group. ",

         "-l, --list-name List the process name as well as the process ID.  (pgrep only.) ",
         "-a, --list-full List the full command line as well as the process ID.  (pgrep only.) ",
         "-n, --newest Select only the newest (most recently started) of the matching processes. ",
         "-o, --oldest Select only the oldest (least recently started) of the matching processes. ",
         "-O, --older secs Select processes older than secs. ",
         "-P, --parent ppid,... Only match processes whose parent process ID is listed. ",
         "-s, --session sid,... Only  match  processes  whose process session ID is listed.  Session ID 0 is translated into pgrep's, pkill's, or pidwait's own session ID. ",
         "-t, --terminal term,... Only match processes whose controlling terminal is listed.  The terminal  name  should  be  specified without the /dev/ prefix. ",
         "-u, --euid euid,... Only match processes whose effective user ID is listed.  Either the numerical or symbolical value may be used. ",
         "-U, --uid uid,... Only match processes whose real user ID is listed.  Either the numerical or symbolical value  may  be used. ",
         "-v, --inverse Negates  the matching.  This option is usually used in pgrep's or pidwait's context.  In pkill's con‐ text the short option is disabled to avoid accidental usage of the option. ",
         "-w, --lightweight Shows all thread ids instead of pids in pgrep's or pidwait's context.  In pkill's context this option is disabled. ",
         "-x, --exact Only match processes whose names (or command lines if -f is specified) exactly match the pattern. ",
         "-F, --pidfile file Read PIDs from file.  This option is more useful for pkillorpidwait than pgrep. ",
         "-L, --logpidfile Fail if pidfile (see -F) not locked. ",
         "-r, --runstates D,R,S,Z,... Match only processes which match the process state. ",

         "-q, --queue value Use sigqueue(3) rather than kill(2) and the value argument is used to specify an integer to  be  sent with  the  signal. If the receiving process has installed a handler for this signal using the SA_SIG‐ INFO flag to sigaction(2) , then it can obtain this data via the  si_value  field  of  the  siginfo_t structure. ",
