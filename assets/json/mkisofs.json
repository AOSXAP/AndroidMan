These are marked as Alpha above. ",
         "Although  HFS  filenames  appear to support uppercase and lowercase letters, the filesystem is case-insensi‐ tive, i.e., the filenames aBc and AbC are the same.

      "DESCRIPTION" : [
         "genisoimage is a pre-mastering program to generate ISO9660/Joliet/HFS hybrid filesystems. ",
         "genisoimage  is  capable  of generating the System Use Sharing Protocol records (SUSP) specified by the Rock Ridge Interchange Protocol.  This is used to further describe the files in the ISO9660 filesystem to a  Unix host, and provides information such as long filenames, UID/GID, POSIX permissions, symbolic links, and block and character device files. ",
         "If Joliet or HFS hybrid command line options are specified, genisoimage will create the additional  filesys‐ tem metadata needed for Joliet or HFS.  Otherwise genisoimage will generate a pure ISO9660 filesystem. ",
         "genisoimage can generate a true (or shared) HFS hybrid filesystem. The same files are seen as HFS files when accessed from a Macintosh and as ISO9660 files when accessed from other machines. HFS stands for  Hierarchi‐ cal File System and is the native filesystem used on Macintosh computers. ",
         "As  an alternative, genisoimage can generate the Apple Extensions to ISO9660 for each file. These extensions provide each file with CREATOR, TYPE and certain Finder flags when accessed from a Macintosh.  See  the  HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS section below. ",
         "genisoimage  takes  a snapshot of a given directory tree, and generates a binary image which will correspond to an ISO9660 and/or HFS filesystem when written to a block device. ",
         "Each file written to the ISO9660 filesystem must have a filename in the 8.3 format (up to 8 characters,  pe‐ riod,  up  to  3 characters, all uppercase), even if Rock Ridge is in use.  This filename is used on systems that are not able to make use of the Rock Ridge extensions (such as MS-DOS), and each filename in  each  di‐ rectory  must  be  different from the other filenames in the same directory.  genisoimage generally tries to form correct names by forcing the Unix filename to uppercase and truncating  as  required,  but  often  this yields  unsatisfactory  results when the truncated names are not all unique.  genisoimage assigns weightings to each filename, and if two names that are otherwise the same are found, the name with the  lower  priority is  renamed  to  include a 3-digit number (guaranteed to be unique).  For example, the two files foo.bar and foo.bar.~1~ could be rendered as FOO.BAR;1 and FOO000.BAR;1. ",
         "When used with various HFS options, genisoimage will attempt to recognise files stored in a  number  of  Ap‐ ple/Unix  file formats and will copy the data and resource forks as well as any relevant Finder information. See the HFS MACINTOSH FILE FORMATS section below for more about formats genisoimage supports. ",
         "Note that genisoimage is not designed to communicate with the writer directly.  Most  writers  have  propri‐ etary  command sets which vary from one manufacturer to another, and you need a specialized tool to actually burn  the  disc.   wodim  is  one  such  tool.   The   latest   version   of   wodim   is   available   from http://www.cdrkit.org/. ",
         "pathspec  is the path of the directory tree to be copied into the ISO9660 filesystem.  Multiple paths can be specified, and genisoimage will merge the files found in all of the specified path components  to  form  the filesystem image. ",
         "If  the  option -graft-points has been specified, it is possible to graft the paths at points other than the root directory, and it is possible to graft files or directories onto the cdrom image with  names  different than  what  they  have  in  the source filesystem.  This is easiest to illustrate with a couple of examples. Let's start by assuming that a local file ../old.lis exists, and you wish to include it in the cdrom image. ",
         "foo/bar/=../old.lis ",
         "will include old.lis in the cdrom image at /foo/bar/old.lis, while ",
         "foo/bar/xxx=../old.lis ",
         "will include old.lis in the cdrom image at /foo/bar/xxx.  The same sort of syntax can be used with  directo‐ ries  as  well.   genisoimage  will  create any directories required such that the graft points exist on the cdrom image — the directories do not need to appear in one of the paths.  By default, any  directories  that are  created  on  the  fly like this will have permissions 0555 and appear to be owned by the person running genisoimage.  If you wish other permissions or owners of  the  intermediate  directories,  see  -uid,  -gid, -dir-mode, -file-mode and -new-dir-mode. ",
         "genisoimage  will  also  run  on  Windows  machines  when  compiled  with  Cygnus'  cygwin  (available  from http://www.cygwin.com/).  Therefore most references in this man page to Unix can be replaced with Win32. "

This helps to save space.  -cache-inodes is default on Unix-like operat‐ ing systems, but -no-cache-inodes is default on some other systems such as Cygwin, because it is  not safe  to assume that inode numbers are unique on those systems.

If two files  have  the same  inode number but are not hard links to the same file, genisoimage -cache-inodes will not behave correctly.  -no-cache-inodes is safe in all situations, but in that case  genisoimage  cannot  detect hard links, so the resulting CD image may be larger than necessary.

UTF-32 uses a plain 32-bit coding but seems to be uncommon.  UTF-16 is used by Mi‐ crosoft with Win32 with the disadvantage that 16-bit characters are not compliant with the POSIX  filesystem interface. ",
         "Modern  Unix  operating systems may use UTF-8 coding for filenames.  Each 32-bit character is represented by one or more 8-bit characters.

If a character is coded in 7-Bit ASCII (used in USA and other countries with limited character set) is maps 1:1 to a UTF-32, UTF-16 or UTF-8  coded Unicode  character.  Character codes that cannot be represented as a single byte in UTF-8 (if the value is > 0x7F) use escape sequences that map to more than one 8-bit character. ",

",
         "Usually character codes 0x00-0x1f are control characters, codes 0x20-0x7f are the 7-bit ASCII characters and (on PCs and Macs) 0x80-0xff are used for other characters. ",
         "As there are a lot more than 256 characters/symbols in use, only a small subset are represented in a charac‐ ter set. Therefore the same character code may represent a different character in different character  sets. So  a filename generated, say in central Europe, may not display the same character when viewed on a machine in, say eastern Europe. ",
         "To make matters more complicated, different operating systems use different character sets for the region or language.  For example, the character code for `é' (small e with acute accent) may be character code 0x82 on a PC, code 0x8e on a Macintosh, code 0xe9 on a Unix system in western Europe, and code 0x000e9 in Unicode.

         "HFS CUSTOM VOLUME/FOLDER ICONS To give a HFS CD a custom icon, make sure the root (top level) folder includes a standard  Macintosh  volume icon file. To give a volume a custom icon on a Macintosh, an icon has to be pasted over the volume's icon in the Get Info box of the volume. This creates an invisible file called Icon&#92;r (`&#92;r' is the carriage  return character) in the root folder. ",

         "HFS BOOT DRIVER It may be possible to make the hybrid CD bootable on a Macintosh. ",
         "A bootable HFS CD requires an Apple CD-ROM (or compatible) driver, a bootable HFS partition and  the  neces‐ sary System, Finder, etc. files. ",
         "A  driver can be obtained from any other Macintosh bootable CD-ROM using the apple_driver utility. This file can then be used with -boot-hfs-file. ",
         "The HFS partition (i.e. the hybrid disk in our case) must contain a suitable System Folder, again  from  an‐ other CD-ROM or disk. ",
         "For  a  partition to be bootable, it must have its boot block set. The boot block is in the first two blocks of a partition. For a non-bootable partition the boot block is full of zeros. Normally, when a  System  file is  copied  to  partition on a Macintosh disk, the boot block is filled with a number of required settings — unfortunately I don't know the full spec for the boot block, so I'm guessing that the following will work. ",
         "Therefore, the utility apple_driver also extracts the boot block from the first HFS partition  it  finds  on the given CD-ROM and this is used for the HFS partition created by genisoimage. ",

This file contains pointers which may not be eas‐ ily or reliably obtained at boot time. ",
