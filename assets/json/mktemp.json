         "Create a temporary file or directory, safely, and print its name.  TEMPLATE must contain at least 3 consecu‐ tive 'X's in last component.  If TEMPLATE is not specified, use tmp.XXXXXXXXXX,  and  --tmpdir  is  implied. Files are created u+rw, and directories u+rwx, minus umask restrictions. ",
         "-d, --directory create a directory, not a file ",
         "-u, --dry-run do not create anything; merely print a name (unsafe) ",
         "-q, --quiet suppress diagnostics about file/dir-creation failure ",
         "--suffix=SUFF append  SUFF to TEMPLATE; SUFF must not contain a slash.  This option is implied if TEMPLATE does not end in X ",
         "-p DIR, --tmpdir[=DIR] interpret TEMPLATE relative to DIR; if DIR is not specified, use $TMPDIR if  set,  else  /tmp.   With this option, TEMPLATE must not be an absolute name; unlike with -t, TEMPLATE may contain slashes, but mktemp creates only the final component ",
         "-t     interpret TEMPLATE as a single file name component, relative to a directory: $TMPDIR,  if  set;  else the directory specified via -p; else /tmp [deprecated] ",
