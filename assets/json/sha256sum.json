      "DESCRIPTION" : [
         "Print or check SHA256 (256-bit) checksums. ",
         "With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input. ",
         "-b, --binary read in binary mode ",
         "-c, --check read SHA256 sums from the FILEs and check them ",
         "--tag  create a BSD-style checksum ",
         "-t, --text read in text mode (default) ",
         "-z, --zero end each output line with NUL, not newline, and disable file name escaping ",
         "The following five options are useful only when verifying checksums: --ignore-missing don't fail or report status for missing files ",
         "--quiet don't print OK for each successfully verified file ",
         "--status don't output anything, status code shows success ",
         "--strict exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines ",
         "-w, --warn warn about improperly formatted checksum lines ",
         "--help display this help and exit ",
         "--version output version information and exit ",
         "The  sums  are  computed  as described in FIPS-180-2.  When checking, the input should be a former output of this program.  The default mode is to print a line with checksum, a space, a character indicating input mode ('*' for binary, ' ' for text or where binary is insignificant), and name for each FILE. ",
         "Note: There is no difference between binary mode and text mode on GNU systems. "
