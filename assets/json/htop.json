         "EXTERNAL LIBRARIES While  htop  depends  on  most of the libraries it uses at build time there are two noteworthy exceptions to this rule. These exceptions both relate to data displayed in meters displayed in the header of htop and were intentionally created as optional runtime dependencies instead.  These exceptions are described below: ",
         "libsystemd The  bindings for libsystemd are used in the SystemD meter to determine the number of active services and the overall system state. Looking for the functions to determine these information at runtime al‐ lows  for  builds  to  support  these meters without forcing the package manager to install these li‐ braries on systems that otherwise don't use systemd. ",
         "Summary: no build time dependency, optional runtime dependency on  libsystemd  via  dynamic  loading, with systemctl(1) fallback. ",
         "libsensors The bindings for libsensors are used for the CPU temperature readings in the CPU usage meters if dis‐ playing the temperature is enabled through the setup screen. In order for htop to show these tempera‐ tures correctly though, a proper configuration of libsensors through its usual configuration files is assumed and that all CPU cores correspond to temperature sensors from the coretemp driver with core 0 corresponding  to a sensor labelled Core 0. The package temperature may be given as Package id 0. If missing it is inferred as the maximum value from the available per-core readings. ",
         "Summary: build time dependency on libsensors(3) C header files, optional runtime dependency  on  lib‐ sensors(3) via dynamic loading. ",
         "CONFIG FILE By  default  htop reads its configuration from the XDG-compliant path ~/.config/htop/htoprc.  The configura‐ tion file is overwritten by htop's in-program Setup configuration, so it should not be hand-edited.   If  no user  configuration  exists  htop tries to read the system-wide configuration from /etc/htoprc and as a last resort, falls back to its hard coded defaults. ",
