If auto-login is enabled, tnftp will check the .netrc (see below) file in the user's home direc‐ tory for an entry describing an account on the remote machine.  If no entry exists, tnftp will prompt for the remote machine login name (default is the user identity on the local machine), and, if necessary, prompt for a password and an account with which to login.  To override the auto-lo‐ gin for auto-fetch transfers, specify the username (and optionally, password) as appropriate. ",

Expansion of a directory name is likely to be differ‐ ent from expansion of the name of an ordinary file: the exact result depends on the foreign oper‐ ating system and FTP server, and can be previewed by doing ‘mls remote-files -’.

         "[user@]host:[path][/] “Classic” FTP format. ",
         "If path contains a glob character and globbing is enabled, (see glob), then the equivalent of ‘mget path’ is performed. ",
         "If the directory component of path contains no globbing characters, it is stored locally with the name basename (see basename(1)) of path, in the current directory.  Otherwise, the full remote name is used as the local name, relative to the local root directory. ",
         "ftp://[user[:password]@]host[:port]/path[/][;type=type] An FTP URL, retrieved using the FTP protocol if set ftp_proxy isn't defined.  Otherwise, transfer the URL using HTTP via the proxy defined in set ftp_proxy.  If set ftp_proxy isn't defined and user is given, login as user.  In this case, use password if supplied, otherwise prompt the user for one. ",
         "If a suffix of ‘;type=A’ or ‘;type=I’ is supplied, then the transfer type will take place as ascii or binary (respectively).  The default transfer type is binary. ",
         "In order to be compliant with RFC 3986, tnftp interprets the path part of an ‘ftp://’ auto-fetch URL as follows: ",
         "•   The ‘/’ immediately after the host[:port] is interpreted as a separator before the path, and not as part of the path itself. ",
         "•   The path is interpreted as a ‘/’-separated list of name components.  For all but the last such com‐ ponent, tnftp performs the equivalent of a cd command.  For the last path component, tnftp performs the equivalent of a get command. ",
         "•   Empty name components, which result from ‘//’ within the path, or from an extra ‘/’ at the beginning of the path, will cause the equivalent of a cd command without a directory name.  This is unlikely to be useful. ",
         "•   Any ‘%XX’ codes (per RFC 3986) within the path components are decoded, with XX representing a char‐ acter code in hexadecimal.  This decoding takes place after the path has been split into components, but before each component is used in the equivalent of a cd or get command.  Some often-used codes are ‘%2F’ (which represents ‘/’) and ‘%7E’ (which represents ‘~’). ",
         "The above interpretation has the following consequences: ",
         "•   The path is interpreted relative to the default login directory of the specified user or of the ‘anonymous’ user.  If the / directory is required, use a leading path of ‘%2F’.  If a user's home directory is required (and the remote server supports the syntax), use a leading path of ‘%7Euser/’. For example, to retrieve /etc/motd from ‘localhost’ as the user ‘myname’ with the password ‘mypass’, use ‘ftp://myname:mypass@localhost/%2fetc/motd’ ",
         "•   The exact cd and get commands can be controlled by careful choice of where to use ‘/’ and where to use ‘%2F’ (or ‘%2f’).  For example, the following URLs correspond to the equivalents of the indi‐ cated commands: ",
         "ftp://host/dir1/dir2/file         “cd dir1”, “cd dir2”, “get file”. ",
         "ftp://host/%2Fdir1/dir2/file      “cd /dir1”, “cd dir2”, “get file”. ",

         "ftp://host/%2Fdir1%2Fdir2%2Ffile  “get /dir1/dir2/file”. ",

Note that if a HTTP redirect is received, the fetch is retried using the new target URL supplied by the server, with a corresponding new path.  Using an explicit -o output is recommended, to avoid writing to unexpected file names. ",
         "If a classic format or an FTP URL format has a trailing ‘/’ or an empty path component, then tnftp will con‐ nect to the site and cd to the directory given as the path, and leave the user in interactive mode ready for further input.  This will not work if set ftp_proxy is being used. ",
         "Direct HTTP transfers use HTTP 1.1.  Proxied FTP and HTTP transfers use HTTP 1.0. ",
         "If -R is given, all auto-fetches that don't go via the FTP or HTTP proxies will be restarted.  For FTP, this is implemented by using reget instead of get.  For HTTP, this is implemented by using the ‘Range: bytes=’ HTTP/1.1 directive. ",
         "If WWW or proxy WWW authentication is required, you will be prompted to enter a username and password to au‐ thenticate with. ",
         "When specifying IPv6 numeric addresses in a URL, you need to surround the address in square brackets.  E.g.: ‘ftp://[::1]:21/’.  This is because colons are used in IPv6 numeric address as well as being the separator for the port number. ",
         "ABORTING A FILE TRANSFER To abort a file transfer, use the terminal interrupt key (usually Ctrl-C).  Sending transfers will be immedi‐ ately halted.  Receiving transfers will be halted by sending an FTP protocol ABOR command to the remote server, and discarding any further data received.  The speed at which this is accomplished depends upon the remote server's support for ABOR processing.  If the remote server does not support the ABOR command, the prompt will not appear until the remote server has completed sending the requested file. ",
         "If the terminal interrupt key sequence is used whilst tnftp is awaiting a reply from the remote server for the ABOR processing, then the connection will be closed.  This is different from the traditional behaviour (which ignores the terminal interrupt during this phase), but is considered more useful. ",
         "FILE NAMING CONVENTIONS Files specified as arguments to tnftp commands are processed according to the following rules. ",
         "1.   If the file name ‘-’ is specified, the stdin (for reading) or stdout (for writing) is used. ",
         "2.   If the first character of the file name is ‘|’, the remainder of the argument is interpreted as a shell command.  tnftp then forks a shell, using popen(3) with the argument supplied, and reads (writes) from the stdout (stdin).  If the shell command includes spaces, the argument must be quoted; e.g. ‘| ls -lt’.  A particularly useful example of this mechanism is: ‘dir  |more’. ",
         "3.   Failing the above checks, if globbing is enabled, local file names are expanded according to the rules used in the csh(1); see the glob command.  If the tnftp command expects a single local file (e.g.  put), only the first filename generated by the globbing operation is used. ",
         "4.   For mget commands and get commands with unspecified local file names, the local filename is the remote filename, which may be altered by a case, ntrans, or nmap setting.  The resulting filename may then be altered if runique is on. ",
         "5.   For mput commands and put commands with unspecified remote file names, the remote filename is the local filename, which may be altered by a ntrans or nmap setting.  The resulting filename may then be altered by the remote server if sunique is on. ",
         "FILE TRANSFER PARAMETERS The FTP specification specifies many parameters which may affect a file transfer.  The type may be one of “ascii”, “image” (binary), “ebcdic”, and “local byte size” (for PDP-10's and PDP-20's mostly).  tnftp supports the ascii and image types of file transfer, plus local byte size 8 for tenex mode transfers. ",
         "tnftp supports only the default values for the remaining file transfer parameters: mode, form, and struct. ",
         "THE .netrc FILE The .netrc file contains login and initialization information used by the auto-login process.  It resides in the user's home directory, unless overridden with the -N netrc option, or specified in the NETRC environment variable.  The following tokens are recognized; they may be separated by spaces, tabs, or new-lines: ",
         "machine name Identify a remote machine name.  The auto-login process searches the .netrc file for a machine token that matches the remote machine specified on the tnftp command line or as an open command argument. Once a match is made, the subsequent .netrc tokens are processed, stopping when the end of file is reached or another machine or a default token is encountered. ",

         "password string Supply a password.  If this token is present, the auto-login process will supply the specified string if the remote server requires a password as part of the login process.  Note that if this to‐ ken is present in the .netrc file for any user other than anonymous, tnftp will abort the auto-login process if the .netrc is readable by anyone besides the user. ",
         "account string Supply an additional account password.  If this token is present, the auto-login process will supply the specified string if the remote server requires an additional account password, or the auto-login process will initiate an ACCT command if it does not. ",

A macro is defined with the specified name; its contents begin with the next .netrc line and continue until a blank line (consecutive new-line characters) is encountered.  Like the other tokens in the .netrc file, a macdef is applicable only to the machine definition preceding it.  A macdef entry cannot be used by multiple machine definitions; rather, it must be defined following each machine it is intended to be used with.
