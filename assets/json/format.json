      "DESCRIPTION" : [
         "The  function set_menu_format sets the maximum display size of the given menu.  If this size is too small to display all menu items, the menu will be made scrollable.  If this size is larger than the  menus  subwindow and the subwindow is too small to display all menu items, post_menu will fail. ",
         "The  default format is 16 rows, 1 column.  Calling set_menu_format with a null menu pointer will change this default.  A zero row or column argument to set_menu_format is interpreted as a request  not  to  change  the current value. ",
         "The  function menu_format returns the maximum-size constraints for the given menu into the storage addressed by rows and cols. ",
         "RETURN VALUE These routines returns one of the following: ",

         "E_POSTED The menu is already posted. ",
         "E_NOT_CONNECTED No items are connected to the menu. ",
