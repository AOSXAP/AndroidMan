      "COMMANDS" : [
         "The commands for cfdisk can be entered by pressing the corresponding key (pressing Enter after the command is not necessary). Here is a list of the available commands: ",
         "b Toggle the bootable flag of the current partition. This allows you to select which primary partition is bootable on the drive. This command may not be available for all partition label types. ",
         "d Delete the current partition. This will convert the current partition into free space and merge it with any free space immediately surrounding the current partition. A partition already marked as free space or marked as unusable cannot be deleted. ",
         "h Show the help screen. ",
         "n Create a new partition from free space. cfdisk then prompts you for the size of the partition you want to create. The default size is equal to the entire available free space at the current position. ",
         "The size may be followed by a multiplicative suffix: KiB (=1024), MiB (=1024*1024), and so on for GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB and YiB (the iB is optional, e.g., K has the same meaning as KiB). ",
         "q Quit the program. This will exit the program without writing any data to the disk. ",
         "r Reduce or enlarge the current partition. cfdisk then prompts you for the new size of the partition. The default size is the current size. A partition marked as free space or marked as unusable cannot be resized. ",
         "Note that reducing the size of a partition might destroy data on that partition. ",
         "s Sort the partitions in ascending start-sector order. When deleting and adding partitions, it is likely that the numbering of the partitions will no longer match their order on the disk. This command restores that match. ",
         "t Change the partition type. By default, new partitions are created as Linux partitions. ",
         "u Dump the current in-memory partition table to an sfdisk-compatible script file. ",
         "The script files are compatible between cfdisk, fdisk(8) sfdisk(8) and other libfdisk applications. For more details see sfdisk(8). ",
         "It is also possible to load an sfdisk-script into cfdisk if there is no partition table on the device or when you start cfdisk with the --zero command-line option. "

      "DESCRIPTION" : [
         "cfdisk is a curses-based program for partitioning any block device. The default device is /dev/sda. ",
         "Note that cfdisk provides basic partitioning functionality with a user-friendly interface. If you need advanced features, use fdisk(8) instead. ",
         "All disk label changes will remain in memory only, and the disk will be unmodified until you decide to write your changes. Be careful before using the write command. ",
         "Since version 2.25 cfdisk supports MBR (DOS), GPT, SUN and SGI disk labels, but no longer provides any functionality for CHS (Cylinder-Head-Sector) addressing. CHS has never been important for Linux, and this addressing concept does not make any sense for new devices. ",
         "Since version 2.25 cfdisk also does not provide a 'print' command any more. This functionality is provided by the utilities partx(8) and lsblk(8) in a very comfortable and rich way. ",
         "If you want to remove an old partition table from a device, use wipefs(8). "
