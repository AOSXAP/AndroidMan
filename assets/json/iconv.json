      "DESCRIPTION" : [
         "The iconv program reads in text in one encoding and outputs the text in another encoding.  If no input files are given, or if it is given as a dash (-), iconv reads from standard input.  If no output  file  is  given, iconv writes to standard output. ",
         "If  no  from-encoding  is given, the default is derived from the current locale's character encoding.  If no to-encoding is given, the default is derived from the current locale's character encoding. "

      "ENVIRONMENT" : [
         "Internally, the iconv program uses the iconv(3) function which  in  turn  uses  gconv  modules  (dynamically loaded shared libraries) to convert to and from a character set.  Before calling iconv(3), the iconv program must first allocate a conversion descriptor using iconv_open(3).  The operation of the  latter  function  is influenced by the setting of the GCONV_PATH environment variable: ",
         "*  If GCONV_PATH is not set, iconv_open(3) loads the system gconv module configuration cache file created by iconvconfig(8) and then, based on the configuration, loads the gconv modules needed to perform  the  con‐ version.  If the system gconv module configuration cache file is not available then the system gconv mod‐ ule configuration file is used. ",
         "*  If GCONV_PATH is defined (as a colon-separated list of pathnames), the system gconv module  configuration cache  is  not used.  Instead, iconv_open(3) first tries to load the configuration files by searching the directories in GCONV_PATH in order, followed by the system default gconv module configuration file.  If a directory  does  not contain a gconv module configuration file, any gconv modules that it may contain are ignored.  If a directory contains a gconv module configuration file and it is determined  that  a  module needed  for this conversion is available in the directory, then the needed module is loaded from that di‐ rectory, the order being such that the first suitable module found in GCONV_PATH is  used.   This  allows users  to  use  custom  modules  and  even  replace  system-provided modules by providing such modules in GCONV_PATH directories. "
