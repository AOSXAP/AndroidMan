         "-l, -loops <COUNT> Specify maximum number of loops the 'ip address flush' logic will attempt before giving up. The de‐ fault is 10.  Zero (0) means loop until all addresses are removed. ",
         "-f, -family <FAMILY> Specifies the protocol family to use. The protocol family identifier can be one of inet, inet6, bridge, mpls or link.  If this option is not present, the protocol family is guessed from other argu‐ ments. If the rest of the command line does not give enough information to guess the family, ip falls back to the default one, usually inet or any.  link is a special family identifier meaning that no networking protocol is involved.

         "-N, -Numeric Print the number of protocol, scope, dsfield, etc directly instead of converting it to human readable name. ",
         "-a, -all executes specified command over all objects, it depends if command supports this option. ",
         "-c[color][={always|auto|never} Configure color output. If parameter is omitted or always, color output is enabled regardless of std‐ out state. If parameter is auto, stdout is checked to be a terminal before enabling color output. If parameter is never, color output is disabled. If specified multiple times, the last one takes prece‐ dence. This flag is ignored if -json is also given. ",
