         "At first that didn't matter too much, since memory modules and disks came in sizes that were powers of  two, so everyone knew that in such contexts kilobyte and megabyte meant 1024 and 1048576 bytes, respectively. What originally was a sloppy use of the prefixes kilo and mega started to become regarded as  the  real true  meaning  when computers were involved.  But then disk technology changed, and disk sizes became arbi‐ trary numbers.  After a period of uncertainty all disk manufacturers settled on the standard, namely k=1000, M=1000 k, G=1000 M. ",
         "The  situation  was  messy:  in the 14k4 modems, k=1000; in the 1.44 MB diskettes, M=1024000; and so on.  In 1998 the IEC approved the standard that defines the binary prefixes given above, enabling people to be  pre‐ cise and unambiguous. ",
