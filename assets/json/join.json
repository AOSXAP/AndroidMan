      "DESCRIPTION" : [
         "For  each pair of input lines with identical join fields, write a line to standard output.  The default join field is the first, delimited by blanks. ",
         "When FILE1 or FILE2 (not both) is -, read standard input. ",
         "-a FILENUM also print unpairable lines from file FILENUM, where FILENUM is 1 or 2,  corresponding  to  FILE1  or FILE2 ",
         "-e EMPTY replace missing input fields with EMPTY ",
         "-i, --ignore-case ignore differences in case when comparing fields ",
         "-j FIELD equivalent to '-1 FIELD -2 FIELD' ",
         "-o FORMAT obey FORMAT while constructing output line ",
         "-t CHAR use CHAR as input and output field separator ",
         "-v FILENUM like -a FILENUM, but suppress joined output lines ",
         "-1 FIELD join on this FIELD of file 1 ",
         "-2 FIELD join on this FIELD of file 2 ",
         "--check-order check that the input is correctly sorted, even if all input lines are pairable ",
         "--nocheck-order do not check that the input is correctly sorted ",
         "--header treat the first line in each file as field headers, print them without trying to pair them ",
         "-z, --zero-terminated line delimiter is NUL, not newline ",
         "--help display this help and exit ",
         "--version output version information and exit ",
         "Unless  -t CHAR is given, leading blanks separate fields and are ignored, else fields are separated by CHAR. Any FIELD is a field number counted from 1.  FORMAT is one or more comma or blank separated  specifications, each  being 'FILENUM.FIELD' or '0'.  Default FORMAT outputs the join field, the remaining fields from FILE1, the remaining fields from FILE2, all separated by CHAR.  If FORMAT is the keyword  'auto',  then  the  first line of each file determines the number of fields output for each line. ",
         "Important: FILE1 and FILE2 must be sorted on the join fields.  E.g., use sort -k 1b,1 if 'join' has no op‐ tions, or use join -t '' if 'sort' has no  options.   Note,  comparisons  honor  the  rules  specified  by 'LC_COLLATE'.  If the input is not sorted and some lines cannot be joined, a warning message will be given. "
